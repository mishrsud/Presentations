# From the MVP to the RAT
## My notes from [Rik Hingham's article on Medium](https://hackernoon.com/the-mvp-is-dead-long-live-the-rat-233d5d16ab02)

## Slide 1: MVP
1. MVP: Minimum Viable Product - term coined by **Eric Ries**, the author of "The Lean Startup"
    1. Defined originally as 
1. Issues:
    1. Cliched - lost its original meaning - often applied to first release of a rudimentary product
    1. *Minimum* is ambiguous - How much is minimum? - Ries says "Probably more minimal than you think"
    1. Dedicated professionals tend to obsess over delivering the perfect product - without validating whether a market/need exists
    1. Sometimes swapped with Minimum Viable *Test* - but what are we testing?
    1. Worries of bad quality force redefinition as *Minimum Valuable Product* or *Minimum Lovable Product*
    1. Leads to larger bets on riskier assumptions

## Slide 2: RAT - Riskiest Assumption Test
1. No false sense of clear, linear path to an optimised solution
1. Explicit: Identify the largest unknown, build just enough to test it
1. Focus on learning - move forward one step at a time
1. Once the riskiest assumption is validated, identify the next biggest one, iterate

## Slide 3: RAT - How to go about RAT-*ing*
1. Express the opportunity as a customer problem, work backwards
1. What needs to be true for the opportunity to exist?
1. Take each assumption, work back to find the main assumption behind them
1. Repeat until the root assumption is identified
1. Work from the bottom - identify evidence that supports the assumption
1. Similar idea to the [5 Whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) by Sakichi Toyoda of Toyota
    1. Technique to identify the root cause of a defect by asking why
    1. *5* is anecdotally the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem

## Slide 3: Alignment of RAT with other practices
1. TDD: Write the test first, then write just enough code to make the test pass
1. Design Sprint: Maximise the rate of learning by minimising the time to try things.
    1. E.g. Google Glass was prototyped in 1 day
1. Primary Question: *Is this the smallest thing we can do to test our riskiest assumption?*
